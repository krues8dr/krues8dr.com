Many early adventure games, such as Rogue, featured dynamically generated
dungeons, so that your adventure would be different every time. Later games like
Diablo used a procedurally generated dungeon, with somewhat-predictable levels
where specific layouts would change. Although these sorts of dungeons are
possible in RPG Maker MV, I wanted a different approach.

Grim Dawn features a static map with several branching paths, but certain paths
will be blocked each playthrough. The game uses some sort of random number
generator that is saved to a particular game file to make sure these paths stay
fixed within a given playthrough.  Minecraft also uses a single, random number
called a "seed" for all of its terrain generation.

I've created an RPG Maker MV plugin that simply creates a very large, random
number stored  to a variable that's saved with your game file. You can use
built-in evaluations for game events to determine if some features/paths/items
should appear or not,  or you can use more advanced functionality or combine
this with other plugins for more interesting interactions.

In the demo below, I've shown a simple implementation with [Hime's Custom Page
Conditions](http://himeworks.com/2015/10/custom-page-conditions-mv/) that simply
shows a path to the east or west, and one is randomly blocked on every new game.
