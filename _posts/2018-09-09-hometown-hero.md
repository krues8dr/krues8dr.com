I&#8217;ve always loved those classic 8-bit and 16-bit RPGs. I grew up on the old Square/Enix games, and I&#8217;ve been replaying for 20 years. I revisit all of those key moments over and over and still have the feeling of wonder that such simple games were able to evoke. I never found that joy in the storytelling once everything became polygon-driven 3D rendered blockiness. But those older games for me are filled to the brim with fond memories.

I&#8217;m also fascinated by the concept of treating a location as if it was a character. It&#8217;s something I was fascinated by in Robert Jordan&#8217;s writing, talking about the red-tiled roof of the Winespring Inn, showing the prosperity of that business against the thatched roofs of the rest of the village, and how these roofs. It&#8217;s something you feel in Joss Whedon&#8217;s Serenity, especially when the disaster in Out of Gas renders the ship &#8211; the crew&#8217;s source of life and livelihood &#8211; dead in space.  This is a feeling that these old games used effectively occasionally: the ruin of Myst, Kefka destroying the world, the destruction of the Mana tree  &#8211; these moments are _palpable_.

I want to create a game where your investment in the game has an impact on the people and towns you encounter, in ways that you can see and feel and that have a real impact on the game. I also want to create a game with an immense sense of scale &#8211; I was always baffled how the entire world of Final Fantasy IV had only 12 towns. Jordan does a fine job of showing every road in the kingdom being littered with small towns of small adventures. Larger modern games such as Skyrim are filled settlements as well.

Most importantly, I want to tell stories.  I want to tinker with players&#8217; expectations, and surprise and delight them. I want to challenge them and give them the opportunity to make a world and stories of their own.

In this blog, I&#8217;ll be exploring these ideas, and working on the mechanics of my first real game, under the working title of Hometown Hero. (I expect this to change as the story develops.)  I&#8217;m using RPG Maker MV as my engine of choice, as it makes it easy to rapidly develop, and exports to Javascript & HTML which I&#8217;m extremely familiar with.  Much of the work I&#8217;ve done so far is in developing plugins to create the features I want, and I&#8217;ll document those efforts here as well.

I&#8217;ve also created [a repository on GitHub for the plugins][1] I&#8217;m creating.
