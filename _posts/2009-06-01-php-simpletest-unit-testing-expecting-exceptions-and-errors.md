Like a good programmer, I try to be good about unit testing [More Info][1]. And also as a good programmer, I throw errors in my PHP where appropriate. I just learned today after a bit of digging through the codebase, that [SimpleTest][2] can be told to expect an Exception (or error) to be thrown in the test. <!--more-->

When using `trigger_error()`, you can use the `expectError()` as follows:

`<br />
	$this->expectError( $errorMessageToExpect, 'My message about this test case' );<br />
	my_code_that_causes_an_error();<br />
`

Note that there is an internal **queue of errors** in SimpleTest, so it will expect precisely one error for each call to `expectError()`.

If, however, you&#8217;re using `throw` you use `expectException` instead:

`<br />
	$this->expectException( $exceptionclass, 'My message about this test case' );<br />
	my_code_that_throws_an_exception_of_type_exceptionclass();<br />
`

You can specify the class of exception to expect in the first parameter &#8211; the usual type would be `Exception`, of course. If you set the first parameter to `false`, it defaults to this type.
