I&#8217;ve been working with our local Legal Aid office for most of my career &#8211; their website was one of the first ones I ever worked on, in fact. Over the last few months, I&#8217;ve been working with [Charmed Designworks][1] to create a new site for LAJC. Behind the scenes, we&#8217;ve switched over to [WordPress][2] and are using some really nice <a href="http://sass-lang.com" SASS CSS Preprocessor">SASS</a> + [Compass][3] to make styling a breeze.
