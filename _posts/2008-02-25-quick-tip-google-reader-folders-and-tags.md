For those not so in-the-know, RSS feeds are a different way of reading content from your favorite sites. The advantage is that all of your content is aggregated into a single location, for easy reading. The main problem is that most every feed-reader sucks or is overpriced. Google has finally polished their free Reader app, and I&#8217;ve switched to it exclusively. The big benefit of it is the ability to group feeds by user-defined categories.<!--more-->

I don&#8217;t know when Google snuck this in under the radar, but they&#8217;ve added the ability to group feeds into folders, and tag individual articles. So if I only want to read my [GTD][1] blogs, and maybe ignore my webcomix for a while, it&#8217;s no problem.
