I remember my first programming class. I was seven. For the life of me, I could not make that damn turtle draw a star while playing music at the same time to save my life (or my grade). This is generally just as painful and traumatic to do in Javascript as it is in Logo.

The thing that makes Scriptaculous totally amazing is native [simultaneous effects][1] [go right here][2]. Meaning, you can do a shape tween and an opacity change all at the same time, no jerkiness or anything. You can just pass in an array of effects to render, and it does them all at the same time.
