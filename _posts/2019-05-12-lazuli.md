I've been playing Minecraft for about a decade now, and these days I spend a lot
of time trying out mods and building modpacks. However, mod management is still
very frustrating in Minecraft. I've created a new command-line tool to make mod
management easier: **Lazuli**.

This tool allows a modpack author to easily download new mods from CurseForge or
elsewhere and combine them into a pack. It also allows a modpack author to
distribute a single, tiny JSON file for their pack, rather than a massive binary
download.  Check out my [Big Fork
modpack](https://github.com/krues8dr/bigfork-lazuli/blob/master/lazuli.config.json5)
for a working example - you'll need [Forge](https://files.minecraftforge.net/)
to install it.

Right now, `install` and `uninstall` work as expected. Other features that are
in-progress include:

* Build a Technic-compatible modpack (95% working)
* Build a static Solder-compatible API for the mod (90% working)
* Manage ore appearance frequency (like in Big Dig) and handle duplicate ores (75% complete)
