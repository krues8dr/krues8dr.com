I&#8217;m really starting to fall for <a href="http://unfuddle.com/" title="Unfuddle" target="_blank">Unfuddle</a>. For those who don&#8217;t know, it&#8217;s another <a href="http://www.basecamphq.com/" title="Basecamp" target="_blank">Basecamp</a> clone for managing projects. I just discovered that if you&#8217;re using the source control (Subversion-based) that they provide, they parse the svn messages for key phrases like &#8220;Resolves Ticket #1001&#8221;, and update the associated ticket in their system to match. Which is a gotcha if you&#8217;re not aware of it, but awesome once you are.<!--more-->

This is not to say that it&#8217;s not without a few major problems. Most notably, there&#8217;s no way to transfer a ticket between projects. Which means no triage/holding area, at least if you&#8217;re sane. This is a pretty fundamental drawback, but with good foresight, you can avoid it altogether.
