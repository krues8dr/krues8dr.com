[Waldo][1] just posted [The State Decoded 0.8 Release][2]. This is a \*huge\* update that we&#8217;ve spent the last few months working on. [577 changed files, 127,076 additions, 5,123 deletions.][3] That&#8217;s a lot of code.

There are a few pieces I would have liked to squeeze into this update, like abstracting the XML import to make JSON importing more user-friendly, and cleaning up the admin system &#8211; but those will come for the 1.0 release. Which is pretty close on the horizon.

In the meantime, check out [the 0.8 release of State Decoded on Github][4]!
