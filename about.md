## Bill Hunt

### Washington, DC, US

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Currently I&#8217;m the **Mission Operations Lead** at the **Office of the Federal Chief Information Officer (OFCIO) at the Office of Management and Budget (OMB / White House)**, where I oversee Federal policy efforts on cloud & data centers, shared services, and workforce reskilling. Within my first year at OFCIO, I distinguished myself through my work as architect of the [**Federal Cloud Computing Strategy (Cloud Smart)**](https://cloud.cio.gov/strategy/), and for which I received the Professional Achievement Award from OMB, an honor usually reserved for three years of exceptional service.

[Kat Duffy][1] and I were named Legal Hackers of the Year 2016 by [DC Legal Hackers][2] for our work at Sunlight Labs. I was also an original member of the [Free Law Founders][3], working on open law, legislation, data policy, and open standards. I&#8217;m also a core developer on [The State Decoded][4], an open source legal data platform.

At heart, I believe in openness, collaboration, and transparency to make things better &#8211; software, teams, and government.

You can read all about everything I&#8217;ve done on [LinkedIn][5], or [download my resume][6].

&nbsp;

For the last few years I&#8217;ve been leading efforts on open data, open law & legislation, civic technology, and policy working at [Sunlight Foundation][7] and [The OpenGov Foundation][8]. Before that, I lead teams in many different technology companies and types of organizations &#8211; startups, client services, government contractors, and so on.

With over 20 years of web development experience, I&#8217;ve worked on hundreds of projects for a variety of clients. I&#8217;ve done a lot of work in government technology, creating policy and tools with officials at every level of government, from legislation to executive agencies &#8211; both domestic and international.  I&#8217;ve also created websites and APIs for Fortune 50 companies, handling thousands of requests per second.  My leadership background has allowed me to help startups and young organizations grow quickly, by implementing and reinforcing strong methodology with my teams &#8211; both remote and on-site.

Previously, I worked as Digital Services Expert for the [United States Digital Service][9] at the [Department of Veterans Affairs][10]; Senior Technology Advisor to [Sunlight Foundation][7]; Lead Developer at [The OpenGov Foundation][8]; Lead DevOps Engineer at [WillowTree Apps][11]; Lead Developer at [Boyd, Caton, and Grant][12] &#8211; working on projects for the Federal Transit Administration; Lead Developer and QA Manager for Hotelicopter; Senior Programmer for [Category 4 Design][13]; and Head of PHP Development for Munk & Phyber (defunct).
