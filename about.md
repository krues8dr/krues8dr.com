  Currently I'm the <strong>Cloud Policy Lead</strong> for the <strong>Office of the Federal Chief Information Officer (OFCIO) at the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)</strong>, where I lead the White House's efforts on Cloud and data center policy. As architect of the <a href="https://cloud.cio.gov/strategy/"><strong>Federal Cloud Computing Strategy ("Cloud Smart")</strong></a>, I work with cabinet-level agencies to drive IT modernization and maturity across the Federal enterprise.
</p>

<p>
  At heart, I believe in openness, collaboration, equity, and transparency to make things better &mdash; software, teams, and government. <span class="web-only">You can read all about everything I've done below, or <a href="/uploads/2019/02/BillHunt-Resume.pdf">download my resume</a>.</span>

        As Cloud Policy Lead for OFCIO, I work with stakeholders across the Federal Government to drive mature practices in infrastructure. I am also currently acting as Mission Operations Lead, managing our teams working on workforce reskilling, shared government-wide services, network modernization, and migration to cloud services. In 2018, I created the Federal Cloud Computing Strategy (Cloud Smart) to address the three largest barriers to IT modernization - cybersecurity, procurement, and workforce skills. This strategy was enthusiastically endorsed by the Administration, our agency partners, and private industry. I also run the Data Center Optimization Initiative, overseeing the management of 12,000 data centers, which has saved taxpayers $2 billion over the last two years.

        In my first year at OMB, I received the prestigious Professional Achievement Award &mdash; an honor usually given after three years of exceptional service &mdash; for my innovative, collaborative approach to this work.
